This repository contains a Python script to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network model for regression tasks using Keras and Scikit-Learn. The model predicts continuous values from a set of input features. The example uses a concrete compressive strength dataset for demonstration.

Project Overview
The script demonstrates:

Building a sequential neural network model with Keras.
Training and evaluating the model using Scikit-Learn utilities.
Calculating the mean and standard deviation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) over multiple iterations.
Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Keras
